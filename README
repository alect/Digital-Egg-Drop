Hey guys:

So this is a pretty standard Xcode 4 Project. 
Once you download the source you should be able to double
click on EggDrop.xcodeproj to open it up. 

Hopefully it should be able to run straight out of the box. If not, let me know. 

Also, until we have an appropriate credits page in the game, I'm putting these here.
